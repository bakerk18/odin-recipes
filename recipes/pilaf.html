        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Rice pilaf is a classic dish that becomes more than the sume of its parts.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 large onion, diced white or yellow</li>
            <li>3 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup orzo</li>
            <li>1 cup long grain white rice, rinsed</li>
            <li>3 cups stock, vegetable or chicken</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon coriander</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium in a cast iron skillet, deep skillet, or pot. Add garlic and onion and saut√© for 60-90 seconds.</li>
            <li>If using stock that's been stored in the fridge, take it out of the fridge to warm to room temperature. Or you can heat it in a pot or put it in a pyrek measuring cup and pop it in the microwave (using cold stock will add to the time it takes to bring it to a boil).</li>
            <li>Add orzo and stir well to coat orzo. Toast for 3 minutes, stirring often.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and then add rice. Stir to ensure that all of the rice is coated in the oil. Toast rice for 4-5 minutes until rice is translucent.</li>
            <li>Add spices, garlic powder, onion powder, coriander, paprika, and salt to the rice and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Slowly add warm or room temperature stock to the pan. Turn up heat and bring it to a boil, then turn down heat to medium / low (a gentle simmer), cover, and let cook for 15 minutes (or follow the cooking time on your rice package). Don't remove the lid until the cooking time is up!</li>
            <li>After 15 minutes, remove rice from heat and let rest, covered, for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove lid, garnish with parsley and then fluff with a fork and serve immediately.</li>
            
        </ol>
